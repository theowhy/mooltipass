Mooltipass functional testing

Electric functional test and firmware programming:
- after bottom PCB assembly, put the PCB on test bed
- use the pins to reprogram and set the atmega32u4 fuses
- once the firmware is programmed and fuses set, the platform boots and detects it is on the test mode
- it will perform its electric functional test (outputs connected to inputs), check the fuses, switch on a green LED if successful
