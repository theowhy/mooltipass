\<Description of and rational behind this PR\>

**In case of a PR concerning the Mooltipass extension:**  
The following test procedure should be done, in the following order.  
  
1) Recall functionality test (Mooltipass unlocked):  
- visit a website you have credentials for  
- make sure you get prompted by your mooltipass  
- accept the credentials sending request  
- make sure you are logged in  
  
2) Storage functionality test (Mooltipass unlocked):  
- visit a website you don't have credentials for  
- fill the username and password field, submit  
- make sure the mooltipass prompts you for password storage **once**  
- accept the credentials storage request  
- run test 1) to make sure credentials are correctly stored  
  
3) Cancel functionality test (Mooltipass unlocked):  
- visit a website you have credentials for  
- make sure you get prompted by your mooltipass   
- do not accept the credentials sending request, close the tab  
- make sure the prompt gets removed on the mooltipass  
  
4) Credentials requests queue test (Mooltipass **locked**)  
- visit a website you have credentials for  
- unlock your mooltipass  
- make sure you get prompted by your mooltipass   
  
5) Credentials requests queue test (Mooltipass unlocked)  
- visit a website A you have credentials for  
- make sure you get prompted by your mooltipass   
- do not accept the credentials sending request  
- visit a website B you have credentials for  
- close the tab containing the website A  
- make sure the first prompt is cancelled on the mooltipass  
- make sure another prompt for website B is displayed on the mooltipass
