GOAL:
- check that all the electrical connections are present on the arduino headers footprints
- done on a testbed with pogo pins

TEST BENCH CONNECTIONS
- PB6 is connected a green and red LED like this: 5V -> 1k > RED anode, RED cathode -> PB6 -> GREEN anode, GREEN cathode -> 1k -> 0V
- PB5 is connected to GND
- PD2 to PF0
- PD3 to PF1
- I2C_SDA to PF6
- I2C_SCL to PF7
- PD4 to PC6
- PD7 to PE6 and PB4

RESULT:
- both GREEN and RED on: FAIL! PB6 or PB5 connection problem
- GREEN on: PASS
- RED on: FAIL!
