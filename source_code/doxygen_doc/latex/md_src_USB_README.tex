The Mooltipass will enumerate as a composite device with hid keyboard and generic hid classes. The keyboard interface is used for sending keypresses and the generic hid is used for transmitting data to/from pc side apps and plugins.

Data sent over the generic hid is made out of a 64 byte packet. The structure of the packet is as follows\+:

buffer\mbox{[}0\mbox{]} = length of data

buffer\mbox{[}1\mbox{]} = cmd identifier for this packet

buffer\mbox{[}2 till 2 + buffer\mbox{[}0\mbox{]}\mbox{]} = packet data

\section*{Current commands }

Every sent packet will get one or more packets as an answer. Texts sent to and from the Mooltipass have payload length that include the terminating 0. In case the user currently is entering his P\+IN, the MP will only reply with a 0x\+B9 packet. The following commands are currently implemented\+:

\subsection*{0x\+A0\+: send debug message }
