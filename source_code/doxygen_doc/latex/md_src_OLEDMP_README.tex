\#\+O\+L\+ED Library for Mooltipass

The O\+L\+ED library implements support for displaying text and graphics for the Mooltipass\textquotesingle{}s 256x64 O\+L\+ED display.

It provides functions for the following features\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Initialise the display.
\item Clear the display.
\item Turning the display on and off.
\item Writing text to the display.
\item Drawing bitmaps on the display.
\item Scroll the display.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Display Buffers}

The library uses the O\+L\+ED\textquotesingle{}s buffer memory to implement two 256x64 display buffers. Either buffer can be selected to be displayed, and either can be selected as the target for drawing text and bitmaps.

The oled\+Write\+Active\+Buffer() function selects the currently displayed (active) buffer as the target for text and bitmap operations, and the oled\+Write\+Inactive\+Buffer() function selects the currently hidden (inactive) buffer instead. By building a display on the inactive buffer, the new image can be quickly shown on the display by swapping the active buffer with the inactive buffer using the oled\+Flip\+Displayed\+Buffer() function.

The inactive buffer can also be scrolled onto the display at a controlled rate with the oled\+Flip\+Buffers(mode, delay) function. The mode can be O\+L\+E\+D\+\_\+\+S\+C\+R\+O\+L\+L\+\_\+\+UP or O\+L\+E\+D\+\_\+\+S\+C\+R\+O\+L\+L\+\_\+\+D\+O\+WN, scrolling the new image from bottom up onto the display line by line or from top down onto display. The delay parameter controls the speed of the scroll by setting the number of milliseconds of delay before scrolling the next line onto the display.
