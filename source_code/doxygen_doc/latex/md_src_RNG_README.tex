How to use the library? how to work with it ?

We only have to remember about two functions.


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 void rngInit(void); // Init Timer0 and WDT Interrupt to generate random numbers
2 void fillArrayWithRandomBytes(uint8\_t* buffer, uint8\_t nb\_bytes); //fill a buffer with random bytes, it's a
       blocking function !
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{2-\/ T\+E\+S\+T\+I\+NG T\+HE L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+RY A\+ND I\+M\+P\+L\+E\+M\+E\+N\+T\+A\+T\+I\+ON }

We have tested the library performance generating 1 milion of bytes. The bytes were sent using mooltipass H\+ID protocol and tools/hiddebug/hiddebug.\+c program and saved into a binary file.

Code extract from MP side\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 case CMD\_GET\_RANDOM\_NUMBER:
2     fillArrayWithRandomBytes(array, 4);
3     hexachar\_to\_string(array[3], &str[0]);
4     hexachar\_to\_string(array[2], &str[2]);
5     hexachar\_to\_string(array[1], &str[4]);
6     hexachar\_to\_string(array[0], &str[6]);
7 
8     usbPutstr((char*)str);
9     break;
\end{DoxyCode}


To get the statistics of the binary file we have used the \href{http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/}{\tt E\+NT Utility }. The Fourmilab E\+NT program is a public domain utility which tests binary data sequences, either as a series of 8 bit bytes, or as a bit stream, with five standard tests for randomness. The output of the E\+NT utility with the 1 milion binary file is\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 Entropy = 7.999785 bits per byte.
2 
3 Optimum compression would reduce the size
4 of this 1000000 byte file by 0 percent.
5 
6 Chi square distribution for 1000000 samples is 297.93, and randomly
7 would exceed this value 3.34 percent of the times.
8 
9 Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4941 (127.5 = random).
10 Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.140340561 (error 0.04 percent).
11 Serial correlation coefficient is -0.001321 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
\end{DoxyCode}


It took 2 days to generate 1 milion bytes.

\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 rng.c               -> RNG library main file
2 random.bin          -> binary sample with 1 milion bytes generated by mooltipass and RNG library
\end{DoxyCode}
