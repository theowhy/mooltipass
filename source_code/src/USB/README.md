USB Information
===============

The mooltipass will enumerate as a composite hid device with a keyboard and generic hid. The keyboard is used for sending keypresses and the generic hid is used for transmitting data to/from pc side apps or plugins.

Data sent over the generic hid is made out of a 64 byte packet. The structure of the packet is as follows:

buffer[0] = length of data

buffer[1] = cmd identifier for this packet

buffer[2 - packetsize] = packet data

Commands
--------
The following commands are currently implemented:

0x01: send debug message
------------------------
(From Plugin/App & Mooltipass): packet data contains the debug message.

0x02: ping request
------------------
(From Plugin/App & Mooltipass): responds with a command packet with the same cmd id, 4 bytes of data

0x03: version request
---------------------
(From Plugin/App & Mooltipass): responds with a command packet with the same cmd id, data contains major, minor version and build number of the mooltipass. The first byte contains the FLASH_CHIP define which specifies how much memory the Mooltipass has.

0x04: set context
-----------------
From Plugin/app: this allows the plugin/application to let the mooltipass know the website/service he's currently on

From Mooltipass: 1 byte data packet, 0x00 indicates that the Mooltipass doesn't know the context, 0x01 if so and 0x03 that there's no card in the mooltipass

0x05: get login
---------------
From plugin/app: request the login for the current context

From Mooltipass: the login if the user has approved the sending of credential / has been authentified, 1 byte 0x00 packet otherwise.

0x06: get password
------------------
From plugin/app: request the password for the current context

From Mooltipass: 1 byte data packet, 0x00 indicates that the Mooltipass didn't send the password, 0x01 if so.

0x07: set login
---------------
From plugin/app: set the login for the current context (either create a credential or select a given credential set)

From Mooltipass: 1 byte data packet, 0x00 indicates that the request wasn't performed, 0x01 if so

0x08: set password
------------------
From plugin/app: set the password for the current context

From Mooltipass: 1 byte data packet, 0x00 indicates that the request wasn't performed, 0x01 if so

0x09: check password
--------------------
From plugin/app: check the password for the current context & selected login

From Mooltipass: 1 byte data packet, 0x00 indicates that password is not correct, 0x01 indicates the password is correct, 0x02 indicates the timer is still running to the request is blocked

0x0A: add context
-----------------
From plugin/app: add a new context inside the mooltipass

From Mooltipass: 1 byte data packet, 0x00 indicates that the request wasn't performed, 0x01 if so

From Mooltipass: the bunch of requested data

0x31: export flash end (for full import/export fw version)
----------------------------------------------------------
From plugin/app: stop flash export

From Mooltipass: end of flash export

0x32: import flash start (for full import/export fw version)
------------------------------------------------------------
From plugin/app: Request for flash contents sending to Mooltipass. A 0x00 in parameter implies user space while a 0x01 specifies the graphics part of flash

0x34: import flash end (for full import/export fw version)
----------------------
From plugin/app: Inform that we finished the flash import

From Mooltipass: 1 byte data packet, 0x00 indicates that the request wasn't performed, 0x01 if so
