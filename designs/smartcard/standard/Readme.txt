The enclosed smartcard template is an inkscape SVG doc defined in mm.
Until a vendor is chosen the placement of the smartcard block is not sufficiently defined.

A temporary png is also enclosed.

Use this template to lay out graphics for sample smartcard designs.

additional resources like svg versions of hackaday logo might also be in here...
